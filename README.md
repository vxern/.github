I'm a guy from the Silesian region of Poland, I live in the UK. I'm 20.

I'm a massive nerd in:
- Programming: JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart, Ruby and Gleam. Dart's been my favourite since I found it four years ago.
- Languages: Polish, English, Romanian, Silesian. I love the Romanian language, especially etymologies and learning its grammar. Armenian is also amazing and will always have a place in my heart. I want to get back to learning it... someday.
- Music (click for favourite song from each):
  - Metal (extreme, industrial, alternative, groove, djent, progressive, technical, hardcore, experimental), some of my favourite bands are [Meshuggah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtO3VCu5wv4), [Fear Factory](https://youtu.be/cFa2vlET-oY&t=162), [Sybreed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzEyvg2rqf0), [Static-X](https://youtu.be/idBR1FcO3lM?si=VfdAbsmN4ThTow3G&t=79), [Car Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZfHjfvtjg4), [Neck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS2JQNIXIUM), [Prong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bXICIWpzeY). It's hard to pick sometimes, there are so many great bands out there. <!-- Without music, I wouldn't be who I am. -->
  - Rap (hip hop, hardcore, horrorcore, aggro, trap), I'm a huge fan of [Słoń](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gL0yQD1IcWA). I listen to other artists like [Eminem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVuYQCa9saw), [Haftbefehl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdLiqQQWdks), [VOLO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZitnLGRZcog), [Miszel]() [18 Karat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVh94dt-4iw), [Phunk B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAtGQQk3E20), and many more.
  - Electronic (big beat, rave, DnB, trance, techno)

My name is Dorian. I'm Silesian, I live in the UK, I'm 21.

# About Me

I'm a massive nerd in:
- Programming: JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart, Ruby and Gleam. Dart's been my favourite since I found it four years ago.
- Languages: Silesian, Polish, English, Romanian. I love the Romanian language, especially etymologies and learning its grammar. Armenian is also amazing and will always have a place in my heart. I want to get back to learning it... someday.
- Music (click for favourite song from each):
  - Metal (extreme, industrial, alternative, groove, djent, progressive, technical, hardcore, experimental), some of my favourite bands are [Meshuggah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtO3VCu5wv4), [Fear Factory](https://youtu.be/cFa2vlET-oY&t=162), [Sybreed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzEyvg2rqf0), [Static-X](https://youtu.be/idBR1FcO3lM?si=VfdAbsmN4ThTow3G&t=79), [Car Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZfHjfvtjg4), [Neck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS2JQNIXIUM), [Prong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bXICIWpzeY). It's hard to pick sometimes, there are so many great bands out there. <!-- Without music, I wouldn't be who I am. -->
  - Rap (hip hop, hardcore, horrorcore, aggro, trap), I'm a huge fan of [SÅ‚oÅ„](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gL0yQD1IcWA). I listen to other artists like [Eminem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVuYQCa9saw), [Haftbefehl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdLiqQQWdks), [VOLO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZitnLGRZcog), [Phunk B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAtGQQk3E20), [Miszel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsnFscQu0w), [G-Ko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU2g2QuZBL4), [18 Karat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVh94dt-4iw), and many more.
  - Electronic (big beat, rave, DnB, trance, techno, party)

I play guitar, I do [harsh vocals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_growl). Sometimes I watch movies. I don't play many games unless they're with friends. I can come off as quite serious, but in reality, I'm totally unserious and actually a little crazy ðŸ˜‚. I type with my left index finger and right thumb on my phone.

You can find me on Discord, my username is `@vxern`. I spend a lot of my time on the [Learn Romanian](https://learnromanian.co.uk) community.
